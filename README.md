# Sockr - A Problem-solver Platform
Sockr is a platform for assisting with learning how to code/script/solve problems.

Solutions for problems can be submitted and evaluated over time with a network of automatic and/or manual test runners that check the submitted solution in a test suite.
If an error/incorrect solution is submitted, Sockr can feed valuable feedback to the submitter, and link to relevant documentation that might be of help.
